## üèÜ About ICS Competition 2025
The **International Computer Science Competition (ICS) 2025** is a contest that brings together student programmers from around the world to solve algorithmic and computational problems under time constraints.  
This competition challenged participants on topics such as:

- Data Structures  
- Graph Theory  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Combinatorics  
- Optimization

## üß† My Approach & Highlights

- **Problem-solving mindset**: For each problem, I first sketched the logic, considered constraints, and optimized the complexity before coding.  
- **Language diversity**: Solutions are implemented in languages like Python and C++ to leverage strengths of each (Python for rapid prototyping, C++ for performance).  
- **Documentation & analysis**: Each solution is accompanied by an analysis file explaining the reasoning, edge cases, and complexity.  
- **Test cases & validation**: I tested on sample, edge, and custom inputs to ensure correctness and robustness.

## üìã How to Use This

1. Browse the `problems/` folder to see the contest challenges (if available).  
2. Open the corresponding source file in `solutions/` to see my implementation.  
3. Read the `analysis/` markdown file to understand the logic, difficulties, and optimizations.  
4. Check the certificate to verify my participation/achievement.

To run a solution locally:
```bash
cd solutions/
# e.g. run problem1 in Python
python3 problem1.py < input.txt
